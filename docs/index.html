  <h1>Blue Planet Ventures Inc.</h1>
  <p><strong>Building conviction, one step at a time.</strong></p>
  <p>Incorporated in Wyoming in June 2024, Blue Planet Ventures was founded to pursue a different kind of investing — one rooted in discipline, transparency, and long-term value.</p>
  <p>Our current focus includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Proprietary equities trading</li>
    <li>Establishing an institutional Bitcoin treasury</li>
    <li>Exploring future mining operations in underutilized regions (including Wyoming)</li>
    <li>Researching AI-enhanced tools for signal generation and capital deployment</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We don’t hold Bitcoin in the company treasury yet — but that’s where we’re headed. Because we believe capital should reflect reality — not speculation.</p>
  <p>Blue Planet Ventures is early, but intentional. Quiet, but principled. And built with a long view.</p>
